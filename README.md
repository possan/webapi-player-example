Note that you will need a Spotify account (either free or premium) to log in to the site.

## How to Run
You will need to run a server. The example is ready to work in the port 8000 by running the following command :

For Mac/Linux :

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

For Windows :

    $ python -m http.server 8000

and open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser. (This requires python to be installed on your machine.)
